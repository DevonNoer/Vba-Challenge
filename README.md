# Vba-Challenge
In this challenge we had to loop through worksheets in excel and output data to new columns.
To complete this challenge I used our previous activities and help from the TA's to do most of the programming. I did have to look up how to do certain things such as how to autofit columns, how to check if a cell was empty, and lastly how to use worksheetfunctions to perform tasks. Using what i learned and read online i was able to figure out most of the solution.
